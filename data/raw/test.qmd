## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)

penguins<- penguins

# Create a scatter plot
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Penguin Body Mass vs. Bill Length", x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Bill Length (mm)")

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
