  abstract = {This study analyzed borehole water quality data collected by the Water Section of the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Development since 1980s. This study was done in order to verify the rightness of the public view that borehole water is synonymous to potable water. The study analyzed water quality data of 5,324 boreholes occurring throughout Malawi. The objective of the study was to determine the extent to which borehole water salts such as: fluorides, nitrates, iron and chlorides are occurring above the concentrations recommended as safe limit of drinking water by the World Health Organization (WHO). The study observes that of the 27,913 boreholes in Malawi, only 5,324 boreholes had been tested for water quality representing about 19.1\% of the total boreholes. Of these 1,676 boreholes had chemical concentration above those recommended by WHO for safe limit of drinking water, representing 31.5\% of the water quality tested boreholes. The study observed that: 567 boreholes had iron, 142 boreholes had fluorides, 81 boreholes had chlorides and 19 had nitrates above those recommended by WHO for safe limits for drinking water respectively. The implication of these findings is that a large number of rural communities in Malawi are continuously ingesting borehole water that has adverse levels of chemical toxicity. The detrimental impacts on human health of such toxicity may require many years of exposure before their impacts are recognized and by that time many rural communities would already have adversely been affected.},

  abstract = {This paper compares data gathered from a study of the chemical and bacteriological quality of drinking-water from 28 rural borehole supplies in Chikhwawa, Malawi, with a tiered classification scheme (Class 0 being ideal through to Class III being unsuitable for drinking without prior treatment) developed by investigators from the Institute for Water Quality Studies, Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, South Africa. In general, the majority of borehole water supplies were classified as Class 0 or Class I supplies based upon the chemical analysis and bacteriological examination. However the classification of a borehole water supply was variable and depended upon the parameter, date of sampling and whether or not it was based on the mean or individual concentration. A number of boreholes were classified as II or III as they contained elevated levels of fluoride and nitrate suggesting that consumption over short or prolonged periods of time may lead to adverse or serious health effects, such as skeletal fluorosis in adults and methaemoglobinaemia in infants. Research is required to develop practicable, affordable and sustainable methods to enable villagers to treat Class II/III water supplies and improve the quality of their drinking-water to a class suitable for human consumption.},

  abstract = {Key Words: Groundwater Infrastructure, Functionality, Accountability, Right to waterThe Malawi 2018 Sector Performance Report produced by the Ministry of Water and Sanitation found that the proportion of people with access to safe water in the country was 86\%, with 57\% of improved water points in rural areas being boreholes with hand-pumps. However, a persistent sustainability challenge plagues the water sector: for over 20 years, the functionality of improved water points has remained between 69\% and 77\%. A study on borehole forensics conducted by the CJF programme found that 30\% of hand-pumps fail within five years of installation.Over the past decade hand pump non-functionality has been attributed to poor community ownership and lack of responsibility to manage the operation and maintenance of the wells. However, in some cases this has been merely hypothetical as the non-functionality of some boreholes has been due to factors that are beyond what communities can manage in terms of operation and maintenance.BASEflow with support from the Scottish Government conducted Borehole Forensics, which is a detailed investigation of a borehole and hand pump performance.\&\#160; Twenty one (21) boreholes were technically assessed and out of these, 13 were found to have unacceptable low yield as per the required Government constant pumping rate test standard of 0.25 liters per second for not less than 4 hours. The failure of the 13 boreholes indicate that the boreholes were developed and constructed to completion and handed over to users when they did not have enough water to meet the required standards.These findings were shared with the relevant stakeholders at Community, District and National level. One major policy recommendation at National level is for the need for adherence to water infrastructure construction standards and the need to empower citizens of rights to water and to hold service providers accountable for failed groundwater supply infrastructure.},
